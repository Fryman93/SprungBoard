# README
This folder contains all files relevant to my first Capstone project for Springboard's Data Science Career Track. Specifically, Lolmatchdata.ipynb contains the code used to interact with Riot Games' API, and obtain the JSON file used to create our desired dataset. LoL.ipynb contains the code accomplishing the data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling.  

The goal of this project was to determine what were the best strategies used in the game that determined victory. By looking at how the data fits into the model, we can extract impactful and interesting features from games that already occurred, and develop meaningful conclusions about what strategies lend themselves to statistically sifgnificant higher win rates.
